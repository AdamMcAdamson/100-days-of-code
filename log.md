# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
Completed 4kyu "Next bigger number with the same digits" kata on codewars with golang. 
I'm feeling good about it.

**Thoughts:**
Applying to Tesla Austin in a few weeks, and the position requires proficiency in Go. 
So far so good.

### Day 2: May 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
Completed 6, 5, and 4 kyu "Esolang Interpreter Series" 1-3 katas on codewars with golang. 
I'm feeling good about it.

**Thoughts:**
#1's tests have a dumb UTF-8 interaction w/ go, what would have been 5 mins ended at almost an hour.
#3 forced my to learn about slices.

### Day 4: May 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
Refactored my solution to "Esolang Interpreter #4" on codewars with golang. 

**Thoughts:**
A light day today. 
I removed a bunch of unnecessary code, and tried a few different techniques to varying success.
Over 7.4 mil interpreted operations before timeout.

### Day 5, May 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
Solved 5 Kyu "Gape in Primes" on codewars with golang. 

**Thoughts:**
Definitely a far too cheeky solution.
Took a break from Esolang Series #4, may come back to it later, wasn't feeling it today but needed to do something.
Definitely a light day, but I got my hour+ in.

**Today's Progress:**
Light day of researching hosting solutions and server side stuff.

**Thoughts:**
Heroku from GitHub seems to be the easiest answer right now.
